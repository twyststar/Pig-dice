        <h1>Pig Dice!</h1>
        <p>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":</p>
        <p>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</p>
        <p>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</p>
        <p>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</p>
        <h4>The first player to score 100 or more points wins.</h4>
        <p>For example, the first player, Ann, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Ann could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again. Ann rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll again. Ann rolls a 1, and must end her turn without scoring. The next player, Bob, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-5, after which he chooses to hold, and adds his turn total of 22 points to his score.</p>
